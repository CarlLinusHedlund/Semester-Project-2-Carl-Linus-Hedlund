# Auction Site 💰

Welcome to our auction site, where you can bid on a variety of items and earn credits by creating listings. 🤑

To get started, sign up for an account and you'll receive 1000 credits to use for bidding. To create a listing, simply click on the "Create Listing" button and provide the necessary details about the item you want to sell. 📝

## Running the program locally

To run this program locally, you'll need to have [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) installed. If you already have it installed, simply navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```nodejs
$ vite
```

This will start the development server and you can access the auction site at `http://localhost:3000`. 💻

Alternatively, if you have npm installed, you can run the program by using the following command:

```nodejs
$ npm run dev
```


This will also start the development server and you can access the auction site at `http://localhost:3000`. Please note that this command assumes that you have a `dev` script defined in your `package.json` file. The `dev` script should specify the command to start the development server, which is typically `vite`. 📦

Here is an example `package.json` file with a `dev` script that uses `vite`:


```nodejs
{ 
"scripts": {
"dev": "vite"
}
}
```


With this setup, you can simply run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

🎉 Have fun bidding and selling on our auction site! 🎉
